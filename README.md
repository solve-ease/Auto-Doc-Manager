## Features

- Secure document generation and storage using blockchain technology
- AI-powered document verification
- User-friendly portal for issuing authorities, verifying authorities, and individuals
- Tamper-proof authenticity of digital certificates
- Efficient document validation against predefined criteria

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity smart contracts)
- Development Environment: Hardhat
- Blockchain Interaction: ethers.js
- Database: MongoDB (for off-chain data storage)

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. `frontend/`: React.js application for the user interface
2. `backend/`: Node.js and Express.js server for API endpoints and business logic
3. `blockchain/`: Solidity smart contracts and Hardhat configuration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-verification-platform.git
    cd document-verification-platform
    ```
2. Set up the frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
3. Set up the backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
4. Set up and deploy smart contracts:
    ```bash
    cd blockchain
    yarn install
    yarn hardhat compile
    yarn hardhat test
    yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
    ```
For detailed instructions on setting up and running each component, please refer to the README files in their respective directories.

## Process Flow

1. **Document Generation**
- Issuing authorities log in to the platform
- They create digital certificates for individuals
- The certificates are stored on the blockchain with a unique hash

2. **Document Storage**
- The platform stores the document hash and metadata on the blockchain
- Off-chain document data is securely stored in the database

3. **User Access**
- Individuals can log in to view their documents
- They can share document access with verifying authorities

4. **Document Verification**
- Verifying authorities receive document access requests
- They can view and verify documents using AI-powered algorithms
- The system checks the document hash against the blockchain for authenticity

5. **Blockchain Verification**
- Smart contracts manage document hashes and access controls
- Every verification is recorded on the blockchain for auditing purposes
