## Introduction

The **Document Verification Platform** is a decentralized solution designed to automate and secure the process of document verification using **blockchain technology** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. This platform addresses the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities of traditional manual verification processes by providing a tamper-proof, transparent, and user-friendly system for issuing, verifying, and accessing official documents.

### Key Problems Solved
- **Time-Consuming Manual Verification**: Automates the verification process, reducing time and effort.
- **Fraud and Tampering**: Ensures document integrity using blockchain's immutability.
- **Lack of Interoperability**: Uses **W3C Verifiable Credentials** for global compatibility.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Implements **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** for selective disclosure of document attributes.

---

## Features

- **Document Issuance**: Issuing authorities (e.g., universities, employers) can create and issue digital documents.
- **Document Verification**: Verifying authorities (e.g., banks, government offices) can validate documents using AI and blockchain.
- **User Portal**: Individuals can view and share their documents securely.
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**: Detects forged documents or anomalies in real-time.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Allows users to prove specific attributes (e.g., age, degree) without revealing the entire document.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enables verification of credentials across multiple blockchains using Avalanche's **Interchain Messaging**.
- **IPFS Storage**: Stores documents securely on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the components.
- **Web3.js**: For interacting with the Avalanche blockchain.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For building the backend server.
- **Express.js**: For creating RESTful APIs.
- **Python**: For AI-powered fraud detection (TensorFlow/OpenCV).

### Blockchain
- **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**: For deploying smart contracts.
- **AvalancheJS**: For interacting with the Avalanche blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: For smart contract development and deployment.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized document storage.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- **Circom**: For designing ZKP circuits.
- **SnarkJS**: For generating and verifying proofs.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Architecture+Diagram) <!-- Add an architecture diagram if available -->

The platform consists of three main components:
1. **Frontend**: A React-based web portal for issuing authorities, verifying authorities, and individuals.
2. **Backend**: A Node.js server with RESTful APIs for document issuance, verification, and ZKP generation.
3. **Blockchain**: Smart contracts deployed on Avalanche Fuji Testnet for storing document hashes and verifying credentials.
